Can a `h1` be used multiple times if in a `section`?
A. Seems to be OK if the significance of the text warrants the heading. Be careful not to use a header 2-6 if there is no h1.

What is the best tag to use for small amounts of text other than a `p` tag?
A. The best I could find is that a `span` text would be the best.
